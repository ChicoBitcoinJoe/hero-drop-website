        Iâ€™ve always dreamed of being a game designer. From the BASIC game programming books I read as a young lad, the game design courses I took in university, and learning Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, all these experiences created a path that lead me to create Hero Drop over the last two years.

        Hero Drop is a simple to learn tabletop roleplaying game with a strong focus on teamwork and creativity. Heroes, both good and evil, roam the land. Some fight divine wars, others fight for themselves, or choose not to fight at all, but all heroes leave a mark wherever they travel. Gameplay is divided into three pillars of adventure: Combat, Social, and Exploration. Combat occurs when a hostile enemy attacks and ends when there are no more hostile enemies. Social interactions occur whenever you interact with a sentient being. Exploration focuses on travel and surviving in different environments. Each pillar is further divided into six talents that define a unique style of gameplay within each pillar.

              An omnipotent storyteller known as a Bard narrates the world and provides opportunities for your character to achieve the goals they set. The Bard describes each scenario to the players and then describes the outcome of any actions the player's take, repeating this process until the players move on to the next scenario. The Bard is also responsible for enforcing rules and always has the final say with any disputes.

              As a player you choose any actions you wish your character to take in the game world. Many simple actions are guaranteed to succeed but some actions require rolling action dice in a contest to determine its success. Each contest belongs to a combination of one pillar and one talent. An action may fit multiple pillars or talents and a player can try to convince the Bard that an action fits a specific pillar or talent.
