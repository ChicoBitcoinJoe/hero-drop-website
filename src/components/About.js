        Hero Drop is a tabletop roleplaying game I have developed over the last two years. Iâ€™ve always dreamed of being a game designer. From the BASIC game programming books I read when I was a teenager, the game design courses I took in university, and learning Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, all these experiences created a path that led me to create Hero Drop.
